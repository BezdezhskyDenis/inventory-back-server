# Project Title: node server App

## Description

The project is a Node.js-based application designed for managing user and business-related data. It involves building a REST API, emphasizing on server-side development with a deep understanding of relevant technologies and libraries like Express.js, MongoDB, and others. Key features include user registration, login, content publication, and editing. The project also incorporates advanced features like a file logger for tracking errors and a security mechanism for temporary user account lockout. The application is structured to provide a comprehensive and secure user experience, focusing on clean, well-organized code and efficient data handling.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

8. **jsonwebtoken (9.0.2)**: Implements JSON Web Tokens for secure data transmission.
9. **lodash (4.17.21)**: Utility library providing convenience functions for common programming tasks.
10. **mongoose (8.1.0)**: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
11. **morgan (1.10.0)**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.

## Installation

Install the node_modules

```shell
npm install
```

You will need 2 .env files:

1. .env.development
2. .env.production

## Running the Project

- To start the application in production mode:

```shell

npm start
```

This sets NODE_ENV to 'production' and runs the app using Node.js.

- For development mode with auto-restart:

```shell

npm run dev
```

This sets NODE_ENV to 'development' and runs the app with nodemon for hot reloading.

## Available Routes

- Here you can find API addresses that the server will respond to:

## Security Features

### Temporary Account Lock

If a user attempts to log in with the same email address and fails due to incorrect password entry three consecutive times, their account will be temporarily locked for a period of 24 hours. This measure is designed to prevent unauthorized access attempts and safeguard user data.

#### How it Works:

- **Lockout Trigger**: After three consecutive failed login attempts with the same email.
- **Lockout Duration**: The user's account will be locked for 24 hours.
- **Account Recovery**: Users can contact support for assistance or wait until the lockout period expires to regain access.
- **Unlock by admin**: Admin can unlock user's account manually through `/users/release/:id`.

## Application Logging

### Error Logging

Our application includes an advanced error logging system to enhance monitoring and debugging. 
This system automatically captures and logs all requests that result in a status code of 400 or higher.

#### Features:

- **Log File Creation**: For each day, the logger creates a new log file in the `logs` directory. The log file is named after the current date (e.g., `2024-02-10.log`). If a file with that date already exists, the logger appends to the existing file.
- **Log Content**: Each log entry includes:
  - Date and time of the request
  - Method
  - URL route
  - Response status code
  - Error message.
- **Log Directory**: All logs are stored in the `logs` directory at the root of the application.

This logging system ensures that all critical errors are recorded, aiding in quick identification and resolution of issues affecting our users.
